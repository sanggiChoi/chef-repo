## 0.7.1
- Version 0.7.0 broke most of the `message_detail_level` settings, only `basic` worked. 0.7.1 fixes it.

## 0.7.0
- Added `send_start_message` configuration which if set to `true` sends out a message when this cookbook is run. This is not quite the same as a [Chef start handler](https://docs.chef.io/handlers.html) but requires no additional setup to run. If you have other start handlers registered, they may run twice due if you turn this setting on. Default setting is `false`.
- Added `send_environment` configuration which if set to `true` sends the node.chef_environment. Default setting is `false`.

## v0.6.0
- Fix a bug in run_context where we should be calling `Chef.run_context`, correct an incorrect method name. (#22)

## v0.5.0
- Added `cookbook_detail_level` configuration which provides the optional ability to include a list of all cookbooks used in the message to Slack. Values inside README.md (#17)
- Some defaults have been removed from the WebHook integration to allow Slack WebHook default configuration to be used, can still be overridden (#16). The slackr integration remains the same. Specifically:
  - `username` no longer defaults to `node.name`
  - `username` no longer defaults to `chef_handler`
  - `icon_emoji` no longer defaults to `:fork_and_knife:`
- Changed `detail_level` to `message_detail_level` in order to clarify its meaning against `cookbook_detail_level`
- Optional `fail_only`, `message_detail_level` and `cookbook_detail_level` attributes for WebHook can now drop down to global attributes (#18)
- `icon_url` now works as expected for WebHook configuration (#15)
- Clarified items in README.md including `channel` being mandatory for the slackr integration; presence of optional `timeout` attribute; what the defaults are (#21)
